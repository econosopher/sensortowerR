## New submission

This is the first submission of `sensortowerR` to CRAN.

## Test environments

* local macOS install, R 4.2.2
* R-hub
* win-builder

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was one NOTE:
* checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time

This seems to be a common note on some systems and does not affect the package's functionality.

Thanks!
