\value{
A tibble with download and revenue estimates.
}
\description{
Retrieves download and revenue estimates of apps by country and date.
Note: All revenues are returned in cents and need to be divided by 100 for dollar amounts.
}
\details{
The API has timeout limitations based on date granularity:
- daily: limit to 1 week segments
- weekly: limit to 3 month segments  
- monthly: limit to 1 year segments
- quarterly: limit to 2 year segments

When auto_segment = TRUE, the function automatically breaks up the date range
into appropriate segments and combines the results.
